### Hi, I’m Dean Kelly 

## I’m a recent graduate of the University of Exeter
   - My Dissertation was on the Optimisation of Cargo Ship Deck Designs
   - Currently I'm using the knowledge gained throughout my Higher Education, by adapting it as I start out my career as a Graduate Software Engineer 
   - Main Goal for 2024: To Use the skills and knowldege learned from my studies and apply them to smash final year. (Having achieved a first class degree, think I smashed this goal :) )
